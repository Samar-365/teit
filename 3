1. Create GIT Repository
● You can either git init locally or clone a remote. Example (clone):
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
2. Pull GIT remote repository(Github) to local repository
git pull origin main
3. Create and fork repository in GITHUB. Create and merge pull request.
Steps (GitHub UI + local):
● On GitHub: go to the original repo → Click Fork (top-right). This creates
github.com/YourUser/original-repo.
● Locally:
git clone https://github.com/YourUser/original-repo.git
cd original-repo
git checkout -b feature/add-my-name
# Make edits, e.g. edit README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add my name"
git push origin feature/add-my-name
● On GitHub (forked repo): you’ll see a Compare & pull request button → click it to
open a PR targeting the original repo (or open PR from fork to original).
● Fill title/description → Create pull request.
● To merge (if you have permission on target repo or the owner merges):
○ On GitHub PR page click Merge pull request → Confirm merge.
○ Or if you are the repo owner: Merge from UI.
Alternative (if you want to merge locally after fetch & merge):
● Upstream is original repo; set upstream and fetch:
git remote add upstream
https://github.com/originalOwner/repository.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
