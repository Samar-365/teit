Exercise 5 — Jenkins 

A. Create and build the job in Jenkins
1. Open Jenkins UI: http://localhost:8080/ (or your Jenkins URL)
2. Click New Item
3. Enter item name, choose Freestyle project, click OK.
4. In Source Code Management select Git, enter your repo URL.
5. Under Build, add Invoke top-level Maven targets (if you use maven) or Execute
shell to run commands.
6. Save and click Build Now.
7. Check Console Output: click the build number → Console Output.
B. Build a pipeline of jobs using Maven
● Option 1: Create multiple freestyle jobs (JobA builds code, JobB runs tests) and add
Post-build Actions → Build other projects to chain.
● Option 2 (recommended): Use a Jenkins Pipeline job with a Jenkinsfile to run
Maven goals in sequential stages:


pipeline {
agent any
stages {
stage('Build') {
steps {
sh 'mvn -B clean package'
}
}
stage('Test') {
steps {
sh 'mvn test'
}
}
stage('Deploy') {
steps {
echo 'Deploy stage (configure as needed)'
}
}
}
}


● Add repository in Pipeline job and configure Jenkinsfile from repo or paste
pipeline script
