Same as exercise 1 with an additional git pull and branch creation.
1–4: (Same commands as Exercise 1 to init, status, configure user, list config.)
5. Pull GIT remote repository (GitHub) to local repository
● If you already have a remote repo URL:
git remote add origin
https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
git pull origin main # or master depending on default branch
Notes
● If the local repo is empty and remote has content, git pull will fetch & merge.
● If clone is easier:
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
6. Create and switch to a new branch called feature/add-my-name
git checkout -b feature/add-my-name
Expected
● Switched to a new branch 'feature/add-my-name'
7. Demonstrate git log command
git log --oneline --decorate --graph
