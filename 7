Exercise 7 — Install Role-Based Authorization Strategy
plugin & configure roles (20 marks)
1. Install plugin
○ Jenkins UI → Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins → Available tab →
search Role-based Authorization Strategy → tick and Install without
restart (or with restart).
2. Enable the strategy
○ Manage Jenkins → Configure Global Security → Under Authorization,
choose Role-Based Strategy → Save.
3. Create and configure roles
○ Jenkins UI → Manage Jenkins → Manage and Assign Roles → Manage
Roles
○ Under Global roles add a role name (e.g., developer, qa, pm) and select
checkboxes for permissions.
○ Example:
■ developer: Overall/Read, Job/Build, Job/Configure, Job/Read,
Job/Workspace, Run/Update
■ qa: Overall/Read, Job/Read, Job/Build, Job/Workspace (no configure)
■ pm: Overall/Read, Job/Read, View/Read (restrict build/configure)
○ Save roles.
4. Assign users to roles
○ Go to Assign Roles tab → Under Global roles, add username → select
checkbox for the role (e.g., developer).
5. Verify permissions
○ Log in as each user or use UI to simulate and try to access/modify jobs:
■ Developer should be able to create and run builds.
■ PM should only view job status and build history.
