Exercise 9 — Detailed Role assignments scenario

This is similar to exercise 7 but with specifics:
1. Install plugin — as in Exercise 7.
2. Create roles for Developer, QA, Project Manager:
○ Developer: Job/Configure, Job/Build, Job/Read, Run/Delete, SCM/Tag (as
needed)
○ QA Engineer: Job/Read, Job/Build, Job/Workspace, Run/View
○ Project Manager: Overall/Read, Job/Read, Run/View (no configure, no build)
3. Assign users
○ Assign dev_user → Developer role.
○ Assign qa_user → QA role.
○ Assign pm_user → Project Manager role.
4. Restrict PM access
○ Ensure PM role does not have Job/Build or Job/Configure permissions —
only view-level permissions.
5. Test role assignments
○ Login with pm_user → Try to edit a job (should be forbidden).
○ Login with dev_user → Create/configure/build job (allowed).
○ Login with qa_user → Trigger builds and view workspaces (allowed asdefined).
